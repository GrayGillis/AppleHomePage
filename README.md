# AppleHomePage
A clone of Apple's Home Page "Apple.com"

I created this project to see how close of cloning Apple's Home Page I could get to on my own with HTML5 and Tailwind CSS

The responsive web page changes the big pictures to different smaller picture depending on the screen size. Lots of text show up as links, when hovering the text has an underline. This was a good test for me to create a landing page by myself. This project was completed without any JavaScript. Creating a navigation bar at the top and using CSS grid for the body was very good practice.
